# README

For the MOIC project, this emulator has to model at a minimum 5 main entities:

* Prison
* Offender (belongs to Prison)
* Movements
* Staff
* Role (linked to Staff and Prison)
* Position (linked to Staff and Prison)

Also Sentence/Booking needs to be modelled

For PVB, the concept of a slot for a prison is also needed
